# 🛡️ cybersecurity-lab

A collection of cybersecurity practice projects, scripts, and notes. This repository helps document my hands-on learning journey in cybersecurity — from scanning and scripting to log analysis and packet capture.

## 🚀 Projects & Tools

### 🔍 Nmap Scans
- Basic Nmap commands and saved results
- Scripts to parse or filter scan outputs *(coming soon)*

### 🛠️ Python Tools
- `scan_network.py`: Scans a given IP range and prints host/port info
- `port_sweeper.py`: Basic port scan over a range of IPs (WIP)
- More tools coming soon (packet capture, log parser, etc.)

### 🧪 Vulnerability Scanning
- Write-ups from using Nessus/OpenVAS or manual enumeration

### 📊 SIEM & Logs
- Sample logs
- Manual and automated analysis approaches

### 🌐 Wireshark Captures
- `.pcap` files and explanations of what they reveal
- Notes on protocols, suspicious traffic, etc.

🔄 **Tool Maintenance**

I regularly update and improve scripts as I learn more efficient or secure techniques.  
Expect small changes, improved error handling, and additional features over time.

Current focus:
- Making tools modular and reusable
- Adding argparse for cleaner CLI usage
- Logging results to files

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Deepen practical skills in scanning, detection, and automation
- Use Python to speed up security tasks
- Learn to document findings clearly

---

## 📌 In Progress
- Port sweeper tool
- Basic log parser
- Capture and analyze sample packets
