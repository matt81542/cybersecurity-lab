# üîé Nmap Scan Examples

This folder contains saved Nmap scan results and the commands used to generate them. These examples are useful for reference, analysis, and learning how different scan types work.

# üîé Nmap NSE Vulnerability Scan ‚Äì Mini Cybersecurity Project

This mini project demonstrates how to perform two types of vulnerability scans using Nmap and its powerful NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine). These scans go beyond basic port scanning to identify known vulnerabilities on a target system.

---

## üéØ Objective

Use Nmap to detect vulnerabilities using two approaches:

- ‚úÖ Built-in `vuln` category scripts
- ‚úÖ The external `vulners` script for version-based CVE mapping

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Nmap** (Network Mapper)
- **NSE Scripts**:
  - `vuln` (built-in)
  - `vulners` (requires version detection)
- **Command Line Interface**

---

## üìò Example Scans

### ‚úÖ 1. Built-in Vulnerability Scan (Nmap `vuln` Scripts)

```bash
nmap --script vuln scanme.nmap.org -oN output_files/vuln_scan.txt
nmap -sV --script vulners scanme.nmap.org -oN output_files/vulners_scan.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The `vuln` scan was partially successful but encountered a known `nsock_loop` error on Windows before all scripts could complete. This is a documented issue with some NSE scripts on Windows systems.
